Pectin hydrogels have garnered significant attention in the food industry due to their remarkable versatility and promising properties. As a naturally occurring polysaccharide, pectin forms three-dimensional (3D) hydrophilic polymer networks, endowing these hydrogels with softness, flexibility, and biocompatibility. Their exceptional attributes surpass those of other biopolymer gels, exhibiting rapid gelation, higher melting points, and efficient carrier capabilities for flavoring and fat barriers. This review provides an overview of the current state of pectin gelling mechanisms and the classification of hydrogels, as well as their crosslinking types, as investigated through diverse research endeavors worldwide. The preparation of pectin hydrogels is categorized into specific gel types, including hydrogels, cryogels, aerogels, xerogels, and oleogels. Each preparation process is thoroughly discussed, shedding light on how it impacts the properties of pectin gels. Furthermore, the review delves into the various crosslinking methods used to form hydrogels, with a focus on physical, chemical, and interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) approaches. Understanding these crosslinking mechanisms is crucial to harnessing the full potential of pectin hydrogels for food-related applications. The review aims to provide valuable insights into the diverse applications of pectin hydrogels in the food industry, motivating further exploration to cater to consumer demands and advance food technology. By exploiting the unique properties of pectin hydrogels, food formulations can be enhanced with encapsulated bioactive substances, improved stability, and controlled release. Additionally, the exploration of different crosslinking methods expands the horizons of potential applications.
