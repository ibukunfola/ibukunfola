## Work Experience and Research Interests

I am a food scientist with a passion for biopolymer characterization, polysaccharide-based material development, and sustainable food packaging. My research integrates multidisciplinary approaches to address critical challenges in the food industry, such as reducing waste and creating environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional packaging. 

A significant focus of my work is on the valorization of agricultural side-streams, using green technologies like enzyme-ultrasonic extraction and deep eutectic solvents to extract functional polysaccharides. My recent projects include developing pectin-based films from okra plant waste and creating novel food emulsifiers aligned with clean-label trends.  

I also contribute to collaborative research on immune-enhancing properties of biopolymers, dietary supplements, and microbial reduction technologies for preserving food quality. These endeavors reflect my commitment to eco-conscious innovation and improving food system sustainability.

Beyond research, I am an active reviewer for several scientific journals and a member of professional organizations, including the Korean Society of Food Science and Technology and the Nigerian Institute of Food Science and Technology (NIFST).

## My Background

I received my Ph.D. and M.A. in Food Science and Biotechnology from Kyungpook National University in South Korea, where I focused on the isolation and application of polysaccharides from agricultural byproducts like okra plant waste. My undergraduate journey began at the University of Ilorin, Nigeria, where I earned my B.Sc. in Food Science with a thesis on processing conditions for cocoyam flour products.

My academic journey has been enriched by global opportunities, including being a Samsung Global Hope Scholar and an exchange scholar under the GKS African and Latin-American Undergraduate Program. These experiences have shaped my dedication to addressing global challenges in food science.

Before my current role, I served as a postdoctoral fellow and graduate research assistant at Kyungpook National University, as well as a quality control officer in the food industry. Each role has fueled my passion for research and teaching, inspiring me to explore innovative solutions for food system challenges.
